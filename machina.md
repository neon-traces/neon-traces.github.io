## Bikes
### G-Bike
_Gravity Bike_. Named for it's special suspension system allowing it to easily support high G-forces, allowing riders to climb up to 90 degrees in the beam highways. Colloquially referred to as _beam bikes_. Not an anti-gravity bike (this isn't science fiction).
### I-Bike
Officially designated the _Interfaceless_, for it's ability to be able to ride on non-interface planes, (e.g. air, water). The hazardous nature of these bikes earned them the nickname Icari. Not for the feint of heart, or anyone who gives too much of a shit about being alive.
### M-Bike
Magnetic-Interface Bike. Can attach and ride on magnetic surfaces.
### IP-Bike
Not a real bike. A piece of software for deploying malicious software to any vulnerable IP adresses it can find.
